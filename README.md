# Object-oriented-image-classification
We created a GUI window using the PyQt library and added buttons and display bars to the window.When the user clicks the "Open Image" button, we use the OpenCV library to load the image and display it in the display bar. When the user clicks the "Classification" button, we choose to use the KNN
algorithm or SVM algorithm to classify the image and display the classification results in another display bar.

You need to install PYQT, opencv, and skielarn on your Python.
